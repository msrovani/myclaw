# Deployment Procedures

> Deployment principles and decision-making for safe production releases.
> **Learn to THINK, not memorize scripts.**

---

## ⚠️ How to Use This Skill

This skill teaches **deployment principles**, not bash scripts to copy.

- Every deployment is unique
- Understand the WHY behind each step
- Adapt procedures to your platform

---

## 1. Platform Selection

### Decision Tree

```
What are you deploying?
│
├── Static site / JAMstack
│   └── Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages
│
├── Simple web app
│   ├── Managed → Railway, Render, Fly.io
│   └── Control → VPS + PM2/Docker
│
├── Microservices
│   └── Container orchestration
│
└── Serverless
    └── Edge functions, Lambda
```

### Each Platform Has Different Procedures

---

## 2. Pre-Deployment Principles

### The 4 Verification Categories

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Production build successful
- [ ] Environment variables verified
- [ ] Database migrations ready (if any)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Team notified
- [ ] Monitoring ready

---

## 3. Deployment Workflow Principles

### The 5-Phase Process

```
1. PREPARE
   └── Verify code, build, env vars

2. BACKUP
   └── Save current state before changing

3. DEPLOY
   └── Execute with monitoring open

4. VERIFY
   └── Health check, logs, key flows

5. CONFIRM or ROLLBACK
   └── All good? Confirm. Issues? Rollback.
```

### Phase Principles

---

## 4. Post-Deployment Verification

### What to Verify

### Verification Window

- **First 5 minutes**: Active monitoring
- **15 minutes**: Confirm stable
- **1 hour**: Final verification
- **Next day**: Review metrics

---

## 5. Rollback Principles

### When to Rollback

### Rollback Strategy by Platform

### Rollback Principles

1. **Speed over perfection**: Rollback first, debug later
2. **Don't compound errors**: One rollback, not multiple changes
3. **Communicate**: Tell team what happened
4. **Post-mortem**: Understand why after stable

---

## 6. Zero-Downtime Deployment

### Strategies

### Selection Principles

---

## 7. Emergency Procedures

### Service Down Priority

1. **Assess**: What's the symptom?
2. **Quick fix**: Restart if unclear
3. **Rollback**: If restart doesn't help
4. **Investigate**: After stable

### Investigation Order

---

## 8. Anti-Patterns

---

## 9. Decision Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] **Platform-appropriate procedure?**
- [ ] **Backup strategy ready?**
- [ ] **Rollback plan documented?**
- [ ] **Monitoring configured?**
- [ ] **Team notified?**
- [ ] **Time to monitor after?**

## 10. Best Practices

1. **Small, frequent deploys** over big releases
2. **Feature flags** for risky changes
3. **Automate** repetitive steps
4. **Document** every deployment
5. **Review** what went wrong after issues
6. **Test rollback** before you need it

---

> **Remember:** Every deployment is a risk. Minimize risk through preparation, not speed.
